# Forecasting Financial Performance of Small Buisnesses

## Project Overview
The idea of this project is to determine the financial viability of a small buisness. We have an understanding that small buisnesses go to accounting firms with fears about going under, but by the time the firm realizes it they notify the buisness too late. The intent is to be able to use machine learning for any small buisness with a simple exchange of data, but our main focus will be LB & Sons. Working with Jerry Barron, the Vice-President of LB & Sons, he has given us a set of data to determine:
  1. The future finanicals of the buisness
  2. The plateau date, if any, of the buisness
  3. Figure out if a buisness is going under before it is too late
